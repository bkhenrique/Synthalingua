## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Contributions
1. **No AI-Generated Code:** We value human creativity and ingenuity in our project. Therefore, we do not accept pull requests (PRs) that contain code generated by AI tools like ChatGPT or other coding AI programs. We seek unique, human-crafted code contributions.

2. **Research and Testing:** Your contributions should be well-researched and tested to ensure compatibility with the minimum specifications for Python outlined in our project requirements.

3. **Documentation:** If you add new features or make changes to existing ones, please update the documentation accordingly.

4. **Code Style:** Please adhere to the coding style and conventions used in the project. This helps in maintaining readability and consistency in the codebase.

### Reporting Issues

2. **Screenshots and Logs:** If applicable, add screenshots and relevant log files to help us understand and address the issue more efficiently.

3. **Search Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check if it has already been reported or fixed. Duplicate issues clutter the issue tracker and slow down response times.

### Pull Requests

2. **Description:** In the PR description, provide a detailed explanation of what changes have been made and why. Link any relevant issues.
